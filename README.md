Hello, I'm Jo√£o Lima,
I am a simple and quiet person who really enjoys spending time with family and friends.
I currently live in Salvador, Bahia, Brazil.
My native language is Brazilian Portuguese, but I can handle myself very well in English, I'm a SI student in UNIFACS and now I am focusing on the security of information and people management
