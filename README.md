Hello, I'm Jo√£o Lima (25th, M),
I am a simple and quiet person who really enjoys spending time with family and friends.
I currently live in Salvador, Bahia, Brazil.
My native language is Brazilian Portuguese, but I can handle myself very well in English, in the future I am thinking of getting a certification to make the language official.
I code in JavaScript and I'm learning React.JS and React Native, I also know HTML and CSS.
I have some notion of UX / UI and i can do an excel spreadsheet.
